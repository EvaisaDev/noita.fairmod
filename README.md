The point of this project is to make Noita a considerably worse experience.  
Example potential features:  
- Falling boulders
- traps that kill the player.
- Mimics for literally everything.
- Whatever other bullshit you can come up with.
   
Everyone is free to add whatever the hell you want, feel free to make a pull request.  
It will be accepted as long as it makes the game a worse experience, and does not make the game completely impossible.
