spaces and exclamation marks in the filename! dont tell nathan!!

uhhh yeah avoid datafiling cuz some things need to be able to disable the entire fairmod to work well


Reasons for the remaining things here:
- `data/shaders/...`
  - these are just testing shaders, they are not a part of the mod and should never be enabled anyway, they are for convenience
- `data/ui_gfx/animal_icons/...`
  - These cannot be procedurally overridden- trust me, I tried.
- `data/ui_gfx/loading_splash/game_hangs.png`
  - Same as above :(



so uhhh yeah I hope you can avoid datafiling where possible kthx byee o/
